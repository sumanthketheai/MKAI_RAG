Excited to share a recent initiative where we built a platform that reimagines how teams interact with enterprise documents and workflows—powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

What We Built
Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
We automated the parsing of SOPs and JIRA exports, extracting key metadata to enable efficient indexing and retrieval.
Storage Architecture

Raw documents are stored in object storage
Embeddings are housed in a vector database for semantic search
Metadata and access controls are managed via a relational database

AI Capabilities

A RAG-based framework combines embeddings and LLMs to deliver contextual answers and summaries
Natural language Q&A and a conversational interface enhance user experience
Document Intelligence is optionally used for high-fidelity parsing

Backend & API Layer
We implemented LLM orchestration to support scalable, intelligent interactions across the platform.
Frontend & Access Control
A secure, role-based UI ensures proper authentication and authorization for all users.
Infrastructure
The platform is deployed on cloud infrastructure with VM support, offering flexibility and scalability.

This solution enables users to instantly retrieve insights from complex documents, ask natural language questions, and receive accurate, context-aware responses. It’s been a rewarding experience leading this effort with a talented team, and I’m continually inspired by how AI can simplify and elevate enterprise workflows.
